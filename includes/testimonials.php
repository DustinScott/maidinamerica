We loved the service, and the cleaner was very nice and friendly. I signed up for the Bi weekly service and my house always seems to be clean! Thanks Maid in America!</p>

                    <p class="description">I was getting ready to place my condo on the market and needed a really good cleaning. I called Maid in America and their house cleaning specialists were top notch right from the start. We got our house clean a few days before the open house and were pleasantly surprised at the depth of cleaning performed. Thanks guys!

                    <p class="description">This letter is to inform you that, as a realtor, I use the services of Maid in America several times a month. I have never been disappointed in their house cleaning specialists because they show up on time and do a great cleaning job. It is obvious that having the right cleaning agents, machines, and muscle power creates a great finished product. In addition, Maid in America knows what it takes to help create the staging of a home for sale.</p>
